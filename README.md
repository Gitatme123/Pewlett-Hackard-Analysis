# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

The purpose of this analysis is to use our newly created SQL query skills to determine the number of employees eligible for retirement by title, as well as to collect data on the number of employees eligible for mentorship with the company. We will then summarize our findings in an ettempt to help our manager be prepared for the silver tsunami as many current employees reach retirement age.

## Overview of Analysis
These key resources we used for this Challenge are included in the Data folder:
1. Employee_Database_challenge.sql file
2. retirement_titles.csv
3. unique_titles.csv
4. retiring_titles.csv
5. mentorship_eligibility.csv

We have also included 2 points on both the number of retiring employees by title and the employees eligible for the mentorship program. We have included answers to the 2 questions as well as 2 additional queries we would run to suppor tthe analysis. All are listed below.

## Results from the Analysis

#### The Number of Retiring Employees by Title

1. According to the chart, the titles that will be the most significantly affected by the number of employees retiring are Senior Engineers and Senior Staff. Without seeing an org chart, I'm not quite sure of the significance of this.

#### The Employees Eligible for the Mentorship Program

* There is a lack of clarity with this request. Are these employees eligible to be a mentor? Or are the eligible to be mentored? I will assume they are eligible to mentor, and therefore be retained as the rest of the retirement age people actually retire.
1. The title for this seems to be the most important attribute to the employees capable of being mentored. Therefore I included a summary of the data by position and added a chart to visualize it.

## Summary of the Analysis
1. How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact?
2. Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?
- I would argue no. There are not enough people ready to retire that meet the criteria for the mentorship program. I also will have to provide the disclaimer that I do not have access to data that suports or rejects anything about the mentorship program. An example I would want to understand would be if every single employee should have a mentor, or if only say 40% qualify for a mentor. There are many organizational things here that we would want expert opinions on before we make a judgement.

#### 2 Additional Queries I would run to further this analysis
